## Around the World in 192 Days
I am on a mission to read a book from every country on Earth - yes, all 192 of them! 
I built this site to share all the books I will read along the way.

A deployed version is live [here on Vercel](https://reading-challenge-red.vercel.app/). 

## Tech Stack
- **React**: For building the component-based user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core language used throughout the frontend.
- **CSV** *(Local Storage)*: Used to store book data locally instead of a database.
- **Heroku** *(Deprecated)*: Initially used for backend data storage, later replaced to reduce cost and complexity.
- **Yarn**: Package manager for handling dependencies and development scripts.

## Usage 
This project uses yarn as the package manager.

To run the project in development, execute the following commands:
```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn dev
```
